# Docker Things and Stuff
A place for various docker related things and stuff.

# Introduction
This is a spot where I will keep things and stuff related to my travels in docker-land.

# Background
I had to perform a demo of Docker for my work so I hammered this script out to help me build and rebuild a github that was failing. Failing because Chef cannot find the github.rb file in /etc/github/ but that is neither here nor there. If you try to run this script raw it will likely fail. Take a look at adding github.rb into /etc/ on the image and then commit it.

# Microservices
Basically I have been working with containers, dockers, or zones since around 2008. Prior to that I was very heavily invested in VMWare. I was an early adopter, the first version I used was an RPM / TGZ that you installed onto a Linux distro which gave you VMware Server.

## Solaris Zones
I know, it might be hard to believe but Sun Microsystems (now Oracle) released Zones in Solaris 10 around 2005. These are similar to zones in that you have one kernel and multiple instances on top of the kernel running processes. 

## BSD Jails
