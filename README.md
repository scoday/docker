# Docker Things and Stuff
A place for various docker related things and stuff.

# Introduction
This is a spot where I will keep things and stuff related to my travels in docker-land.

# Background
I had to perform a demo of Docker for my work so I hammered this script out to help me build and rebuild a github that was failing. Failing because Chef cannot find the github.rb file in /etc/github/ but that is neither here nor there. If you try to run this script raw it will likely fail. Take a look at adding github.rb into /etc/ on the image and then commit it.
